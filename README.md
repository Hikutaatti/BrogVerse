## HTML
### 1. Basic HTML structure is present.
Used throughout the page, example in index.html page

Used most, if not all of the elements a lot. All pages have different examples of these

### 3. Use of forms, links, and media.
Ie. review.html has a good form. Images used accross the page in topnav + the favicon

### 4. Tables are effectively used.
Index.html line 14

### 5. Consistent use of semantic HTML throughout, ensuring better structure and understanding of the content.
Used throughout the page, great example in the news.html content


## CSS

Different fonts used throughout file, colors in topnav etc.

Most, if not all elements/div's have id's/classes to them
